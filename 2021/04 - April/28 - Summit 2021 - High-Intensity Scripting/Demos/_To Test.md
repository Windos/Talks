# Things I should investigate as test cases?

[ ] Download a file via `Invoke-WebRequest`
[ ] `@() += $Stuff` still slow
[ ] `| Out-Null` faster?
[ ] `ForEach-Object` + Parallel vs `PoshRSJob`
[ ] `dispose` blocks?
[ ] `Group-Object`
[ ] `.where` and `.foreach` methods
[ ] Are ternary operators faster than if/else?
