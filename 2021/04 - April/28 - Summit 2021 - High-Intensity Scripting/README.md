# High-Intensity Scripting: Revisiting Speed Optimizations with PowerShell 7 (April 28)

Featured Session @ [PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit 2021](https://events.devopscollective.org/event/powershell-devops-global-summit-2021/)

There’s a number of things the PowerShell community know speed up their scripts. These range from common sense to superstitious.

I’ve talked about optimizing PowerShell for Speed at the PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit 2018, but with the work that’s been put into PowerShell 7 and beyond it’s time to revisit the topic.

This is a demo heavy session checking to see if old truisms remain valid, and if you even need to make any changes to your existing scripts to leave Windows PowerShell in the dust once you’re behind the wheel of its opensource big brother.

Who knows, PowerShell 7 may just be a performance enhancing drug that should be banned from the Olympics.
