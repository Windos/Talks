You know what toast notifications are,
you know that you can generate them using the BurntToast PowerShell module.
But now you're wanting to branch out a little and try some fancy toast.
Maybe toast topped with avocado, hummus, or maybe Marmite?

Wait, wrong toast. It's an easy mistake!

Come along and see how you can make your toast notifications more visually appealing with GIFs and hero images.
How you can dynamically update existing notifications with new information.
And finally, how you can trigger certain actions directly from a notification.
